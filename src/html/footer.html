    The Ethiopian calendar (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ዘመን አቆጣጠር) or Eritrean calendar is the principal calendar used in Ethiopia.
    </p>
    <p>
    The calendar has twelve months of thirty days plus five or six epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month. A sixth epagomenal day is added every four years, without exception. There is a gap of seven to eight years between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars.
    </p>
    <p>
    New Year's Day occurs on September 11th in the Gregorian Calendar; except for the year preceding a leap year, when it occurs on September 12th. (This date correspondence applies for the Gregorian years 1900 to 2099.)
